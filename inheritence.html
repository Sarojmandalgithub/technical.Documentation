    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

        derived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class
        base class (parent) - the class being inherited from
        To inherit from a class, use the : symbol.
        
        In the example below, the Car class (child) inherits the attributes and methods from the Vehicle class (parent):
        
        Example
        <pre>
            // Base class
            class Vehicle {
                public:
                string brand = "Ford";
                void honk() {
                  cout << "Tuut, tuut! \n" ;
                }
            };
            
            // Derived class
            class Car: public Vehicle {
                public:
                string model = "Mustang";
            };
            
            int main() {
              Car myCar;
              myCar.honk();
              cout << myCar.brand + " " + myCar.model;
              return 0;
            }
        </pre>
