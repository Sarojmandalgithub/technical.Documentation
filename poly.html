    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>
        Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

        Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
        
        For example, think of a base class called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Derived classes of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.):
        
        Example
        <pre>
        // Base class
        class Animal {
            public:
            void animalSound() {
                cout << "The animal makes a sound \n";
            }
        };
        
        // Derived class
        class Pig : public Animal {
            public:
            void animalSound() {
              cout << "The pig says: wee wee \n";
            }
        };
        
        // Derived class
        class Dog : public Animal {
            public:
            void animalSound() {
              cout << "The dog says: bow wow \n";
            }
        };
        </pre>
    </p>
